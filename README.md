Action is programmed in ECMAscript ES6/7 (including async/await).
Transpilation is provided by [babel](https://github.com/babel/babel).

## Setup

### Installation

#### Prerequisites

Action requires Node.js >=7.6.0 (we're using 7.6.0 in development).
We recommend using [n](https://github.com/tj/n) to install and manage your
node versions.

Action also depends on [RethinkDB](https://rethinkdb.com/). Make sure
you have it installed. If you have OSX, we recommend homebrew so
upgrades are as easy as `brew update && brew upgrade rethinkdb`

Action also uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) which can be installed by running `npm install -g yarn`

Additional dependencies include [redis](https://redis.io/), and
[watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html) (required by relay).

#### Source code

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ParabolInc/action.git
$ cd action
$ cp .env.example .env # be sure to verify the API keys have useful values
$ rethinkdb # in a separate window
$ yarn
$ npm run quickstart
```
_Remember: if RethinkDB is running locally, you can reach its dashboard at
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) by default._

The majority of Action's Javascript files are written using the emerging
ECMAScript ES6 and ES7 standards. If you open a source file and see
syntax errors, you may have to configure your editor differently.
Our team's editors ([Atom](https://atom.io/) and
[Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)) have plugins which parse
our project's Javascript transpilation options directly from
[.babelrc](./.babelrc). If your editor has this option, it's the best way
to go.

### Client-side development

In this mode, webpack will hot swap your updated client modules without
needing to restarting the development server.

```bash
$ npm run build
$ npm run dev
```
[http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

### Server-side development

In this mode, the server will build client bundle and start a production
server with the fresh code.

```bash
$ npm run bs
```
[http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

### Database development

The database schema version is managed by
[migrate-rethinkdb](https://github.com/ParabolInc/migrate-rethinkdb).
Migration scripts are stored in `./src/server/database/migrations`.

If you make changes to the Action schema, make certain to create a new
migration.

### Test development

```bash
$ npm run db:migrate-testing # Only needs to be run once
$ npm run test # Runs all tests
```

### Getting Started on Windows
Currently, many of the config files are written for a Unix based shell like bash. If you plan on contributing (awesome!),
but are working on a Windows machine, you can follow these steps to get started. Note this is just __one__ way of setting
up the environment for Windows, but it is the least likely to give you trouble down the road.

1. Follow the instructions to install [bash for windows](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about)
2. Open cmd and type `bash`
3. Install node >= 7.6.0 __inside__ of your bash instance
4. Install the dependencies for [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html)
5. Install watchman from source
6. Start an instance of rethinkDB
7. Start an instance of redis
8. Navigate to the directory of your choice
9. ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/ParabolInc/action.git
   $ cd action
   $ yarn
   $ npm run quickstart
   ```

If you run into problems, run each of these commands separately and watch for errors.
 ```
 npm run db:migrate
 npm run build:dll
 npm run build:relay
 npm run dev
 ```

## Bringing your database up to date

```bash
$ npm run db:migrate
```

## Migrating backward and forward

The following commands are available to migrate your database instance
forward and backward in time:

   * `npm run db:migrate-up` - migrate up one schema version
   * `npm run db:migrate-up-all` - migrate upward to latest schema
   * `npm run db:migrate-down` - migrate down one schema version
   * `npm run db:migrate-down-all` - migrate downward completely (will erase everything)

## Exploring the data API:

While running the app in development mode, navigate to
http://localhost:3000/graphql for testing out new queries/mutations

## Exploring component design:

We've begun assembling a pattern library of all of the components we've created
for the app. Too see them, navigate to http://localhost:3000/patterns
